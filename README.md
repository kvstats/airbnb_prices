# Toronto Airbnb Prices
The City of Toronto is the most populous city in Canada and is recognized as an international centre
of business, finance, arts, and culture. With the large amount of visitors Toronto sees everyday, an
increasing number of people have been turning to alternative forms of accommodations when they stop
by. This analysis aims to examine the different factors that affect the prices of Airbnbs in Toronto such
as the size of the listing, information about the hosts, review scores, and the neighbourhoods or districts
they are located in. Using a hierarchical fixed effect model, we model the log price using a room type
structure using a combination of these covariates and find that the most important factors that affect
listing prices are the number of people it accommodates, the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and
the location of the listing. Across all models tried, it was found that entire homes/apartments had a
higher starting price than any of the other room types, with hotel rooms having the lowest intercept.
